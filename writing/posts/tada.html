          <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em>.<br>
          <em>OUCH</em> <em>OUCH</em> <em>OUCH</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there was one thing I hated the most, it was someone ruining my sleep. It was Ramasamy trying to wake me as I slept peacefully. It was trek day today!
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried ignoring him, thinking he'd give up.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em> &hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          OKAY! I acknowledged by squinting my eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I lay there for two more mins, while he went to wake up the other idiot — Anmol. Grumbling, I tossed around, glanced at the clock — 4:05 AM, it read.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I really hope it's worth it. >.<", I thought and got up.
        </p>

        <p>
          4:35 AM, we were all ready. Someone checked the WhatsApp group.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The headcount only shows 3 people. :/", Ramasamy said.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Naice", I thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group chat which was formed to discuss the trek had 100+ members, the registration was closed days earlier with a registration limit of 20 people. We had registered a day late and somehow got confirmed (probably because we said we had bikes) and now there were only 3 people responding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anmol pinged a few times and it was decided that we would meet up at Urappakkam.
        </p>

        <p>
          And so we did introductions, <em>BLAH</em> <em>BLAH</em> <em>BLAH</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          FOOD — <em>check</em><br>
          Water — <em>check</em><br>
          Camera — <em>check</em><br>
          Petrol — <em>check</em><br>
          Extra Clothes — <em>check</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus began our journey. A few unsynchronized miles — tea shop — long wide almost empty highway — sunrise. It took around 2–3 hours (actually I don't remember how long it took, lol). We reached the basecamp (if you could call it that. It wasn't that big of a trek, but still&hellip; <em>HYPE</em> I guess. :P).
        </p>

        <p>
          As we walked along the mud road, we caught a glimpse of the destination. It looked like a narrow stream hidden behind some rocks and bushes, it looked beautiful&hellip; and far. :|
        </p>

        <p>
          A couple of photos (or maybe a lot? xD) later, we were back on our way, the road turned into a narrow path and before we knew it, it was streams and stones.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we came across what seemed to be our first stream crossing, an unlikely (or likely) friend joined us. A dog! :D A very friendly one that too. He sniffed all of us and made sure we were all ok to go. He was our guide. He would go a couple yards and stop and wag his tail beckoning us to follow and we would. So on we went, 9 of us and the dog.
        </p>

        <p>
          The path now turned to a climb with pools of water and big rocks. But all these seemed like a piece of cake for our guide. He would climb and sit somewhere and wait, while we made our way through what seemed like a maze, stumbling and grumbling all the way. :P
        </p>

        <p>
          He was the nicest thing out there that day as far as I know :D (trust me when I say nice, because there is a lot more coming). At one point someone even stepped on his tail when he was resting, but all he did was just give out a yelp and continue wagging his tail. <em>awwww</em> :')
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we came across the first big pool. And it was gorgeous!
        </p>

        <p>
          I dipped my feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>sssssssssssssssssssss</em> It was the best feeling I had had the whole day.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oi, Anmol. We'll take a dip?", I asked.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anmol was all in. And so we plunged&hellip; err, I mean walked into the water. :P
        </p>

        <p>
          As the water got deep enough, Anmol started swimming, while I walked in chest deep water. We spent a while there as the rest of the gang caught up. We got out of the water fully drenched and feeling <strong>AWESOME</strong> B|. Then we realised something, the trek had just started. There is much more to come! :D
        </p>

        <p>
          On we went, and after a while we came across another big pool and this time it was deeper. We decided we would finish this one with a small dip. On we went again and as we reached the next pool, we were greeted by some unwelcoming hosts — <strong>MONKEYS</strong>! And they were everywhere. A group of people swimming in the pool had left their bags unattended, and down came a couple, opening everything and taking whatever they thought was eatable. Well, now we understood how it's gonna be.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reached a rock which was a little hard to climb. We still managed to climb it and waited for the others. One by one they came and climbed and went. Wait a minute, there was another guy in the story — Ramasamy? What happened to him? Well, yeah he was there at the tail end helping the slowpokes catch up. And as we helped the last of them&hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oi, kiska bag h yeh? (Whose bag is this?)", Anmol asked. As I looked up I saw that a monkey was at my bag.
        </p>

        <p>
          "****!"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Scare him away. Throw him some food or something.", I said. But we had nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We tried to shoo him, but to no avail. At one point, I even started making faces&hellip; :|
        </p>

        <p>
          The monkey opened the top zipper and started going through my stuff. Luckily there was nothing there that was worth losing. But the others had my laptop cables and stuff. And boy was I gonna get in trouble if I lost them. (Yea you might be thinking why this idiot would carry laptop cables, etc on a fucking trek. I'm wondering the same. I forgot to take them out, I guess. :'D)
        </p>

        <p>
          As the monkey played around with the bag on top of the rock, it slipped from his hand and down it went tumbling to the bottom. And there were another bunch down at the bottom. Luckily, they didn't open anything else and nothing of value was lost. After waiting a couple of minutes for them to leave, I climbed down and got my bag and on we went again. We reached the next pool. This was by far the biggest and deepest one yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oi, teach me how to swim.", I asked Anmol.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sure.", Anmol said.
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked into the water. Grabbed his hand, lifted my legs. <em>Oh My God!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I was only going around in a semi-circle around Anmol, this was as close to swimming as I had ever come and it felt <strong>AMAZING</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good half an hour later, Anmol having made a video on the selfie stick swimming to the middle of the pool and all, we left for the next one.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we made our way across harder terrain, the group got split and this time it was just the three of us.
        </p>

        <p>
          And so on we went. And ironically as we went higher and higher we saw more and more people. Finally we reached another stream which would be our final camp. We waited for the rest to catch up.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was still some climb left. A steep inclined one with wall climbs here and there. But everyone was exhausted and seemed content with how far they'd come. So I borrowed Anmol's phone (It had the best camera) and went. After a 5 minute climb, I came across the last pool and it did not disappoint. A big <strong>YELLOW POOL</strong> with 3 streamy waterfalls. I sat there for some time taking it in. The quiet surroundings. The occasional chirp, the yellow water, the trickling waterfalls. <em> peace </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Back I went to join the gang for food. As we opened our food bag, we were once again taunted by the unfriendly hosts. They closed in whenever they thought they had a chance. But we didn't give in. As we finished our food, we threw whatever was leftover. Nothing seemed to satisfy them. One even had the guts to come close to us and try to steal it from our hands. After we finished our lunch, we decided we'd go back down after a while. A couple of photos later, we made our way back. Largely uneventful, we made our way back to the dam which we had seen at the beginning and waited for the rest of the gang to catch up. The dam was now teeming with families and gangs just like us out to chill for the weekend. We took a final dip and made our way back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Close to 5 P.M (or 6 I'm not sure), we started our journey back fully satisfied with our first trek. We decided we'd eat at a dhaba that the organizer of the trek knew. We reached the place, ordered. After 10 mins, onions arrived — they were supposed to be appetizers. Gone in a minute. Everyone was <strong>SO HUNGRY!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The food came after what felt like half an hour, we gobbled it down. Then we took a final selfie, said our goodbyes and off we left.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like how every movie has a climax, we have reached ours, my friend. :)
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, the three of us together. We did fine for a while. As we neared Chennai, Anmol signalled that we should stop for petrol at the next pump. I signalled back that we are yet to reach reserve so we'll be fine. Barely 10 seconds later, Anmol's bike started to gasp for fuel and he signalled that he was stopping. We stopped a little ahead. As I came back and checked, I realised that his bike was running on reserve mode the whole time and now it was empty.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>great</em> <em>just great</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Middle of the highway. 9 P.M, no gas station in sight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ramasamy took out his phone and googled — "Petrol pump".
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>searching</em><br>
          .<br>
          .<br>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hey there is one not that far!", Ramasamy exclaimed.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oi, Anmol give me a bottle, I'll get the petrol, you guys watch the bikes.", I said.
        </p>

        <p>
          I got the bottle and hurried across the road, crossed to the service road and started walking. I put out my hand and bottle and continued walking.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>vrrooooom</em><br>
          <em>nope</em><br>
          <em>vrooooom</em><br>
          <em>again, no luck</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          "I should have taken a helmet too. It would have been easier to get a hitch. >.<", I thought. But the third one stopped and I got on and said, "Anna petrol pump. Bike petrol kaali aach highway-le. (Bro, I need to go to the petrol pump, bike ran out of petrol on the highway)". He nodded his head and took me there. I got my petrol and made my way back. This time I put my hand and bottle with petrol out and the first guy stopped. This time there was sympathy. :P
        </p>

        <p>
          I made my way back to the bikes triumphantly. But no, this isn't over yet. Now there was another problem. The cap of the petrol tank just won't open. We tried and tried. After what seemed like 10–15 mins of hopeless prodding with both bike keys, Ramasamy said, "Move let me try something." He put his fingers on both sides and turned it and <strong>VOIL&Agrave;</strong>. Somehow it slid into place and we rejoiced. We filled it up and thought we'd finally be on our way.
        </p>

        <p>
          But no, it wouldn't be that way. I walked back to my bike (RE Classic), sat, kicked. Nothing&hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>nothing</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>NOT LIKE THIS</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This used to happen with this bike once in a while. The pressure from the kick would leak somewhere near the carburetor (or some other thing, I don't know :P). I tried adjusting this and that and kicking again. This went on for 15 mins when Anmol suggested pushing and starting it from first gear. I guess it was worth a try, because I'd at least kicked 30–40 times and this was more tiring than the whole trek (trust me you'll know if you have tried kick starting an RE Classic >.<).
        </p>

        <p>
          And so they pushed. When the odo reached 15 I said, "Ok let go". I let go of the clutch.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>screech</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          It came to a grinding halt. God was I frustrated. After everything, this has to happen now! >.<
        </p>

        <p>
          I started kicking again. This time out of frustration although I knew fully well that the chances of it working were close to nil.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em> <em>kick</em> &hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>nothing</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Not even a kick-back. Then Anmol suggested we try pushing one more time, this time both him and Ramasamy would push.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sure."
        </p>

        <p>
          And so they pushed again. This time I let it go up to 20 and as I let go of the clutch, I sensed <strong>LIFE</strong>. <em>wring</em> I SWUNG THE ACCELERATOR HARD.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>VROOM</strong> <strong>VROOM</strong> <strong>VROOM</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          It came to life and I let out a SCREAM. Boy was I relieved. I looked back, Anmol was already running towards his bike. Ramasamy was already climbing on the back seat.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Polam (Let's go)", he said.
        </p>

        <p>
          And off we went, tired as fuck, yearning to reach home and fall flat on our beds. :'D
