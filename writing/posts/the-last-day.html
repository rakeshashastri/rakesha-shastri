          I picked up my bag and phone. I got up from my chair, took a step back and looked at my cubicle. <em>Nothing</em>. I felt nothing, even though this was my last day. Probably because I was looking forward to getting out of there as soon as I could. Then I looked at my neighbours — 3 Malayalees — they were smiling. They knew what I'd been through the last week and a half, and they were genuinely happy.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ok. I'll see you guys then.", I said a little sad inside knowing that I'll miss them. They were very understanding and helpful, offering me whatever they knew on my situation and the things to be done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Situation? Ok. Here's some context.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had just graduated (if you can call almost a year ago "just" :x) and joined an IT company for "training" for the real world. (Apparently everything you learn in college is useless. Wait! Then why do they ask for college degrees while recruiting? o.O. Ok, getting sidetracked here. Back to the story!). After training, I was posted in Bengaluru for a role I did not like and literally forced to take it up, even though I did exceptionally well in "training". So I was looking to get a release and now I finally got it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ok, so where were we? Ah yes, the leaving part!
        </p>

        <p>
          "Enjoy man!", said one.<br>
          "No more worries now. Go break a leg.", another said.<br>
          The third just kept smiling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I walked to the manager's cabin (he was the nicest person who was not a peer that I'd met at the company).
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sir.", I said gesturing that I was leaving. The middle-aged gentleman smiled meekly and said, "Okay man. All the best."
        </p>

        <p>
          I then walked to the door and swiped my card.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>beep</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The door clicked. I pulled.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>kdack</em> <em>kdack</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          It was stuck. It used to happen to me once in a while. I looked to the lady sitting next to the door. She gestured, <em>Again?</em> >.<. She was used to this by now.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Last time :x", I thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          She swiped, it clicked. I opened and closed the door behind me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I headed straight to the stairs. I swiped.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>beep</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          This time the door yielded.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Pdack</em> <em>Pdack</em> <em>Pdack</em> <em>Pdack</em> <em>Pdack</em> &hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          10, 9, 8&hellip; G.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I exited the ODC, I looked at the vertical garden and the pool nearby that I'd always admired.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Yea, goodbye." I gave them a wistful smile and walked by.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the cool Bengaluru breeze blew across, chilling me and giving me goosebumps like always, I thought, "Finally&hellip;".
        </p>

        <p>
          The only thing left for me to do was submit my ID card. I crossed over to the next ODC where the admin building was. I swiped one last time, went to the admin, submitted my card. As the card left my hand, a wee bit of pain pinched me as I remembered the good times I had had in Chennai. I comforted myself saying that I was going there again anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I left the office and neared the door out of the ODC, I had a feeling of calmness soothe me for all the frustrating things I endured the last week. As I passed the door, I thought, "Yea, I'm done."
        </p>

        <p>
          "SIR!", came a call from behind. I turned around a little puzzled.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Bag checking sir.", she smiled. It was one of the security staff who was stationed at the entrances and exits. They check bags at random from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>facepalm</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          "Fine.", I thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bag checking is usually namesake and they just open your bag, peek and close it. But this time she took her time somehow sensing that she wasn't getting another chance.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ok sir, Thank you. ID?"
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Uh oh</em> :|
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I spent the next 5 minutes explaining to her that I'd just resigned and that I had been relieved of my ID card. She let me go in the end.
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked past the ODC and onto the walkway which was decorated with perfectly pruned gardens on both sides. I looked back one last time at the towering buildings. At the top it read "&lt;C********&gt;".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Yea, **** you too.", I muttered.
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked along the walkway enjoying the breeze. As I walked farther and farther, I felt lighter and lighter. As I exited the office park, I took one last look back and thought, "Once in a lifetime". The wind howled in approval. The chill didn't bother me anymore, cause I was FREE and I was going HOME.
