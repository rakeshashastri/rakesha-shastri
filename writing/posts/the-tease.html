          I slumped into my chair, tired and sweaty after the game. As I opened my laptop to watch an episode of a TV series I was following currently&hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>WHAM</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The door slammed shut. I almost fell out of my chair to the sound of it. I went to the door and opened it to see who it was. As I opened the door, it hit me on the face, hands, legs everywhere. The front door was wide open (as it always is :/) and a brisk wind was blowing. This was not uncommon, but there was something about the wind this time that was different. Curious, I put on my shirt and walked out the door. Everything a few hundred meters away seemed hazy like an out of focus camera shot. At first I thought it was drizzling, but come on? Who am I kidding? It's just June and let's be real, it doesn't rain in June in Chennai. So what was it?
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked closer and suddenly I realised what it was — it was dust from the road! And as I looked to the side of the gate facing the road, another wave blew — this time along with it came dead leaves and pieces of torn plastic and whatnot. I closed my eyes and turned my face and took a few steps back to come out of it. But my face still lit up because I finally figured out what was tingling me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The smell! I know&hellip; I know&hellip; all the waste from the road wouldn't smell any good. But it wasn't that smell. The wind had another smell we can all relate to. The smell of when it rains for the first time. The scorching earth feeling quenched. That one. And boy did my heart leap!
        </p>

        <p>
          I ran to my door and shouted, <em>"Oye Ankit! Roshan! Aaja baahar! Ye dekh kya mast hawa chal raha h yehan pe!"</em>. And we walked straight to the bench which was usually occupied by people who came out to chill in the evenings. We sat there waiting for the gift. I felt a drop here and there and there was still that smell. We started talking — the usual stuff — arguing about things there was no point in arguing on, pulling each other's legs at small silly things that were said or done.
        </p>

        <p>
          And before we knew it, it was gone. The wind had settled. The blaring horns of vehicles outside in the traffic jam were more obvious. The smell — gone. Just like that. Nature had teased us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We talked a while longer and finally we decided to call it a day agreeing finally on something — it wasn't raining today. <em>Sigh.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          And so we went back to our rooms a little bittersweet. But, surely it was a sign of things to come, right? :D
