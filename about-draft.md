## About

### Growing Up

Born in Mangaluru, where Kannada came first. Moved to Thiruvananthapuram before I could notice — Malayalam became second nature before I knew what "second language" meant.

Used to read everything I could get my hands on. Started with Tinkle and Amar Chitra Katha, graduated to TinTin, then fell headfirst into Harry Potter and Naruto. Somewhere in there, English stopped being a school subject and became the language I thought in.

Cricket took over the top spot around my teens — reading didn't stand a chance against a game that could last all day. Movies pushed reading down to third around college, and it never quite recovered.

### Languages

Five languages, each picked up differently. Kannada from birth. Malayalam from the neighbourhood in Thiruvananthapuram. English from books. Hindi from Bollywood. Tamil from the streets of Chennai.

Every language came with a different way of thinking, a different sense of humour, a different way of being polite. You don't really notice until you're switching between three of them in the same conversation.

### Now

Making a living in Chennai, building SaaS. Cricket over every other game, two wheels over four.
